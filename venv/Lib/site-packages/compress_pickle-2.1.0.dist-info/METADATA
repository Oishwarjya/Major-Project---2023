The standard [pickle package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) provides an excellent default tool for serializing arbitrary python objects and storing them to disk. Standard python also includes broad set of [data compression packages](https://docs.python.org/3/library/archiving.html). `compress_pickle` provides an interface to the standard `pickle.dump`, `pickle.load`, `pickle.dumps` and `pickle.loads` functions, but wraps them in order to direct the serialized data through one of the standard compression packages. This way you can seemlessly serialize data to disk or to any file-like object in a compressed way.

`compress_pickle` supports python >= 3.6. If you must support python 3.5, install `compress_pickle==v1.1.1`.

Supported compression protocols:
- [gzip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html)
- [bz2](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html)
- [lzma](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html)
- [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html)

Furthermore, `compress_pickle` supports the [`lz4`](https://pypi.org/project/lz4/) compression protocol, that isn't part of the standard python compression packages. This is provided as an optional extra requirement that can be installed as:

```bash
pip install compress_pickle[lz4]
```

Please refer to the [package's documentation](https://lucianopaz.github.io/compress_pickle/html) for more information
